This page here is composed of javascript,CSS and obviously HTML. The javascript here is used for the flipping of the circle and the revealing of the external links, while css styles the entire page and the entire page is structured by HTML.

                     <h1>Yes, I know this is the main reason anyone is going to open this page as the discussion forum may be the main attarction of our website and needs the most explanation. So, let's start with the database, so we used the firebase database offered by google to store different pieces of information like name, password and messages. Basically, each message that gets posted is given a unique ID for the managment of messages which makes it easy to find the messages if required. On opening the page, the user is prompted to enter the name and password which is stored in the database and using if function, the browser looks whether the name and password have been stored before or not. Now if the name and password have been used before to send messages the browser provides the option to delete the messages but if the password or name or both differ due to different cases, you wouldn't be able to delete any previous messages made by the username. Now using the if function again if the name is equal to our names (US - "CREATORS") and a the password is equal to a predefined password, an option to delete any message is avialable.You can enter the username as Arjun Kapoor or Arnav Khandelwal and enter the password as MODERATOR123 to understand this deeply. Now this is just the overview of the page, you can read the code and understand it better reading the comments.</h1>
